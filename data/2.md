## Account Existence Check for low level calls

### Description:
As written in the [solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), the low-level functions call, delegatecall and staticcall return true as their first return value if the account called is non-existent, as part of the design of the EVM. Account existence must be checked prior to calling if needed.

### Remediation:
Check before any low-level call that the address actually exists, for example before the low level call in the callERC20 function you can check that the address is a contract by checking its code size.
